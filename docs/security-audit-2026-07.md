# Security Audit — PM Workload Tracker

Date: 2026-07-02
Scope: `index.html` (single-file app, ~16.6k lines), Supabase schema, CDN dependencies, docs.
Method: manual source review focused on XSS sinks, the Supabase auth/RLS model, secret handling, dependency integrity, and injection sinks (`eval`/`Function`/`javascript:`).

## Summary

The app is a single-user-per-account tool: Supabase Row Level Security scopes every
row to `auth.uid()`, so there is **no server-side data sharing between users**. "Team"
and "relay" data lives entirely inside one user's own record. That materially lowers the
impact of stored XSS (it is largely self-inflicted) — with one important exception: data
imported from external `.xlsx` files becomes app state, so a malicious spreadsheet is a
real, attacker-influenced input path.

The core defensive control — `escHtml()` — is applied consistently to task/session
names, notes, and "waiting on" text, but is **not** applied to project labels, billing
codes, project display names, sub-code codes/labels, or person/member names, which are
interpolated raw into `innerHTML` in ~40 places. Note also that `escHtml()`
(`index.html:16537`) escapes only `& < > "` — it does **not** escape single quote (`'`)
or backtick, so it is safe for HTML body and double-quoted attributes but not for
single-quoted attributes or as a JS-string escaper. Combined with the lack of Subresource
Integrity on CDN scripts and an API key that is synced to the cloud and written into
exported backups, the notable findings are below, most severe first.

---

## Findings

### 1. Stored XSS via unescaped project labels / billing codes / names — Medium

`escHtml()` protects task names and notes, but project metadata is rendered raw. Examples:

- `index.html:6268` — `<span class="task-category">${projLabel(task.project)}</span>`
- `index.html:6265`, `6286`, `6329`, `10572`, `10582`, `10683` — `title="${projLabel(...)}"`
- `index.html:5766`, `8519`, `8601`, `8618`, `14429`, `14439`, `14481`, `14509`, `16048` — `${proj.label}` / `${proj.billingCode}`
- `index.html:7458`, `7461`, `7506`, `7509`, `7582`, `7614` — `${proj.name}`
- `index.html:9199`, `9208`, `9217` — `${projLabel(item.project)}` in the team board
- `index.html:13982`, `13992` — project labels inlined into `onclick="..."` in the duplicate-merge UI

`projLabel()` / `projColor()` (`index.html:5709-5710`) return the stored value verbatim.

The same raw-render pattern extends to other metadata fields (escaping is applied
inconsistently — often escaped in one render path and raw in another):

- **Billing codes:** `index.html:11976` (Capacity), `14439` (Allocations).
- **Sub-code `code` / `label`:** `index.html:8107` (`sc.code` raw while `sc.label` is
  escaped on the same line), `12879` (`s.label` raw — contrast `13008`, which escapes it).
- **Person / member names:** `index.html:9980` (owner pills, `${m}`), `15387` (project
  member chip), `15182` (assign dropdown visible span — the `onclick` arg is quote-escaped
  but the displayed name is not).

**Why it's reachable from untrusted input:** the allocations Excel import auto-creates
projects with `label: jobLabel || billingCode` taken straight from spreadsheet cells
(`index.html:12577-12583`), with no sanitization of the stored label. A crafted `.xlsx`
whose job-name cell is `<img src=x onerror=…>` (or a label containing `">` to break out
of a `title="…"` attribute) is stored as a project label and executes on the next render.
Manual project entry (`index.html:16063-16071`) is the same sink but self-authored.

**Impact:** script runs in the app origin, where it can read the Supabase session token
and the Anthropic API key from `localStorage` (see Finding 3) and exfiltrate them.

**Fix:** wrap every project label / billing code / name interpolation in `escHtml()`, the
same way task names already are. For `style="background:${proj.color}"` and the
`onclick="...${label}..."` cases, escaping the label is still required; prefer building
those nodes with `textContent`/`dataset` + event listeners rather than inlining values
into an `onclick` string.

### 2. No Subresource Integrity (SRI) on third-party CDN scripts — Medium

`index.html:2732` and `2734` load `@supabase/supabase-js@2` and `xlsx@0.18.5` from
jsDelivr with no `integrity=` or `crossorigin=` attribute (grep for `integrity=` returns
0 matches). The `@2` tag also floats to whatever the CDN currently serves.

**Impact:** a CDN compromise or a malicious `@2` publish executes arbitrary JS with full
access to the Supabase session and the stored API key — full account takeover. This is the
highest-impact single point of failure because it needs no user action.

**Fix:** pin exact versions and add `integrity="sha384-…"` + `crossorigin="anonymous"` to
both `<script>` tags. Regenerate the hashes whenever the pinned version changes.

### 3. Anthropic API key synced to cloud and written into plaintext backups — Low/Medium

`wt_api_key` is stored in `localStorage`, is listed in `SYNC_KEYS`
(`index.html:4456`), so `save()` pushes it to the Supabase `user_data` table via
`cloudSave()`, and it is included verbatim in the JSON produced by `exportBackup()`
(`index.html:4257-4276`, which iterates `SYNC_KEYS`).

**Impact:** the secret leaves the device by two paths the user may not expect — anyone
handed a backup file, or with read access to that Supabase row, gets the key. RLS protects
the row from *other* users, but the export path has no such guard.

**Fix:** exclude `wt_api_key` from `SYNC_KEYS`/backup export (keep it device-local), or at
minimum warn in the backup UI that the file contains a secret. If cloud sync of the key is
intended, document it explicitly.

### 4. Minor unescaped self-authored sinks — Low

`_currentUser.user_metadata.display_name` is interpolated raw into `innerHTML` at
`index.html:16205`. The value is the user's own signup name, so this is self-XSS only, but
it should use `escHtml()` for consistency. The disabled Brain Dump review modal
(`renderReviewContent`, `index.html:16469+`) would render AI/spreadsheet-derived task
fields into `innerHTML`; it is currently unreachable (`submitBrainDump` early-returns at
`index.html:16322-16325`), but should be escaped before the feature is re-enabled.

### 5. Attribute-breakout / CSS injection via unescaped color in `style` — Informational

`style="background:${proj.color}"` (e.g. `index.html:6265`, `9200`, `11850`, `14439`),
`value="${proj.color}"` (`index.html:15987`), and `delegateTagsHtml` (`index.html:5742`)
inline color values without escaping. Because these are double-quoted attributes and the
color is not run through `escHtml`, a stored color value containing a `"` (e.g.
`red" onmouseover="alert(1)`) would break out of the attribute and inject a new event
handler — a stronger vector than pure CSS injection. Colors normally come from a
constrained color picker or a fixed palette on import, so exploitability is low, but the
value should be validated as `#rrggbb` (or emitted via `dataset` + CSS).

Similarly, date operands in single-quoted `onclick` JS-strings — e.g.
`openRescheduleModal('${task.id}','${item._occurrenceDate || task.due}')`
(`index.html:6267`, `6270`, `6291`, `6314`) — are unescaped. IDs are `uid()` (alphanumeric,
safe), but a crafted/imported date string could break out of the single-quoted JS string.
Low exploitability under normal UI, but worth constraining if dates ever become free-text.

## What was checked and looks correct

- **RLS model** (`index.html:4092-4132`): `user_data` and `profiles` enable RLS with
  per-user `auth.uid() = user_id` policies for select/insert/update/delete. Data is
  correctly isolated between accounts.
- **Anon key embedding** (`index.html:4135-4136`): the baked-in Supabase anon key is a
  public key and is safe to ship as long as RLS is enforced (it is). No `service_role`
  key or other high-privilege secret is present in the source.
- **Escaping of primary user text**: task/session/subtask names, `notes`, and `waiting`
  fields are consistently passed through `escHtml()`.
- **No dangerous eval sinks**: no `eval(`, `new Function(`, or `javascript:` usage. The
  two `.outerHTML` reads (`index.html:9269`, `9278`) are reads for string assembly, not
  sinks for untrusted markup beyond the label issue in Finding 1.
- **Passwords** are read from the auth form and passed to Supabase; they are never stored
  locally.

## Remediation applied (2026-07-02)

All findings above were fixed in `index.html` in this change:

1. **CDN Subresource Integrity (Finding 2).** Both `<script>` tags are now
   version-pinned (`@supabase/supabase-js@2.110.0`, `xlsx@0.18.5`) with
   `integrity="sha384-…"` + `crossorigin="anonymous"`, and the cdnjs xlsx
   fallback carries the same hash. A tampered CDN file will now be refused by
   the browser instead of executing. (The supabase URL was pointed at the
   package's published `dist/umd/supabase.js`, which is the same minified UMD
   that exposes the `supabase` global — jsDelivr can't produce a stable hash
   for the on-the-fly `.min.js` variant.)

2. **Stored-XSS escaping (Findings 1, 4).** `escHtml()` was hardened to also
   escape `'` and backtick, and every user/import-controlled field that reaches
   `innerHTML` is now routed through it: project labels, billing codes, project
   display names, sub-code codes/labels, person/owner names, and the signed-in
   display name — across My Tasks, Projects, Team (list/person/board views),
   Timesheet, Capacity, Allocations, the duplicate-merge modal, the shared
   dropdown, and project-member chips. Inline `onclick`/`onchange` handlers that
   pass a person name now escape it for both the HTML-attribute and JS-string
   context (a plain HTML-escape is insufficient there because the parser decodes
   entities before the JS runs); the duplicate-merge success messages no longer
   interpolate a label into an `innerHTML`-setting handler at all.

3. **API key kept device-local (Finding 3).** `wt_api_key` was removed from
   `SYNC_KEYS`, so the Anthropic key is no longer pushed to Supabase or written
   into exported backup files; a maintainer comment documents why.

4. **Color attributes (Finding 5).** Color values interpolated into `style="…"`
   / `value="…"` are now escaped, closing the attribute-breakout path.

### Verification

Changes were verified in a headless Chromium run: the pinned CDN files load and
satisfy SRI; seeding a malicious `"><img onerror=…>` payload as a project label,
billing code, sub-code, task field, owner, and board-person name produced **zero
injected elements and zero script execution** across every tab and all three
team views, while ordinary labels containing `'` and `&` still render correctly
(no double-escaping). The full inline script also passes a `node --check` parse.

## Second-pass sweep (July 2026, post-delegation work)

A systematic re-audit of every `innerHTML`/`outerHTML`/inline-handler sink
(four parallel region scans over the full file) found and fixed a second
batch of missed escapes:

**Stored-XSS sinks (type a/c — `escHtml` added):**
- Projects tab header: `proj.label` / `proj.billingCode` (`renderProjCodeContent`).
- Projects tab group label: big-project name (`_src`).
- By-Person view: person name in group header text.
- Team board card: person name in the est `title=""` attribute.
- Week planner day preview: `projBillingCode`/`projLabel` for logged entries.
- Capacity month detail: `proj.billingCode`; sub-code header `fullCode`.
- BigTime import status banner: every detail list (new/renamed/deactivated/
  archived/zeroed names) rendered import-controlled labels raw.
- Reconcile rows: `billingCode`, `label`, and the row `title="${tip}"`.
- Manage Projects: billing-code `value=""` attribute; project tag chips.
- Account panel: `_currentUser.email`.
- Brain-dump review cards: AI-returned `project label/priority/est/category/
  waiting` tags and update-row field keys rendered raw (AI output is untrusted).

**Handler-context sinks (type b — dual-escape completed):**
- `toggleTeamOwnerPill` / `toggleDelegatePill` / `_toggleTeamPersonCollapse` /
  `removeProjTag` interpolations escaped only `'`, not `"` — a double quote in
  a person name or tag broke out of the `onclick` attribute.
- **`showDropdown` redesigned:** the generic dropdown interpolated `it.value`
  raw into `onclick="_ddSelect('…')"`, and reassign/delegate flows pass person
  names as values. Items are now referenced **by index** (`_ddItems` array) —
  never interpolate a dropdown value into its handler.

**Data-source hardening:**
- `importBackup` sanitizes restored `wt_projects_meta` KEYS to `[a-z0-9_-]`
  (remapping references in tasks/team/bigprojs/completed and both allocation
  maps). Project keys are interpolated into dozens of inline handlers on the
  assumption the app generated them; a crafted backup could smuggle a
  quote-breaking key.

### Regression net

`.claude/skills/verify/run.sh` now runs an invariant suite whose scenario
`08-escaping.js` seeds hostile payloads into every store (persons, project
meta incl. sub-codes/tags, tasks, deliverables, big projects, completed) and
asserts zero injected elements / zero execution across all six tabs and the
board view. It failed before this batch and passes after — run it before
shipping any render-path change.
